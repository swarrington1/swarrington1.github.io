Abstract:

Quantitative comparison of the white matter organization of the human neocortex with that of the chimpanzee and macaque shows a wide distribution of areas with a uniquely human connectivity profile, including the frontal-parietal fiber systems and the temporal visual pathway. Functional decoding of these areas shows their involvement in language, abstract reasoning, and social information processing. Overall, these results counter models that assign primacy to prefrontal cortex for human uniqueness.
