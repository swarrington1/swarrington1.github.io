Abstract:

Non-human primates are extensively used in neuroscience research as models of the human brain, with the rhesus macaque being a prominent example. We have previously introduced a set of tractography protocols (XTRACT) for reconstructing 42 corresponding white matter (WM) bundles in the human and the macaque brain and have shown cross-species comparisons using such bundles as WM landmarks. Our original XTRACT protocols were developed using the F99 macaque brain template. However, additional macaque template brains are becoming increasingly common. Here, we generalise the XTRACT tractography protocol definitions across five macaque brain templates, including the F99, D99, INIA, Yerkes and NMT. We demonstrate equivalence of such protocols in two ways: (a) Firstly by comparing the bodies of the tracts derived using protocols defined across the different templates considered, (b) Secondly by comparing the projection patterns of the reconstructed tracts across the different templates in two cross-species (human–macaque) comparison tasks. The results confirm similarity of all predictions regardless of the macaque brain template used, providing direct evidence for the generalisability of these tractography protocols across the five considered templates.
