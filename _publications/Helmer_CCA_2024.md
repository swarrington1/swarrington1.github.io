Abstract: 

Associations between datasets can be discovered through multivariate methods like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) or Partial Least Squares (PLS). A requisite property for interpretability and generalizability of CCA/PLS associations is stability of their feature patterns. However, stability of CCA/PLS in high-dimensional datasets is questionable, as found in empirical characterizations. To study these issues systematically, we developed a generative modeling framework to simulate synthetic datasets. We found that when sample size is relatively small, but comparable to typical studies, CCA/PLS associations are highly unstable and inaccurate; both in their magnitude and importantly in the feature pattern underlying the association. We confirmed these trends across two neuroimaging modalities and in independent datasets with n ≈ 1000 and n = 20,000, and found that only the latter comprised sufficient observations for stable mappings between imaging-derived and behavioral features. We further developed a power calculator to provide sample sizes required for stability and reliability of multivariate analyses. Collectively, we characterize how to limit detrimental effects of overfitting on CCA/PLS stability, and provide recommendations for future studies.
