Abstract: Developmental and evolutionary effects on brain organisation are complex, yet linked, as evidenced by the striking correspondence in cortical expansion changes. However, it is still not possible to study concurrently the ontogeny and phylogeny of cortical areal connections, which is arguably more relevant to brain function than allometric changes. Here, we propose a novel framework that allows the integration of connectivity maps from humans (adults and neonates) and non-human primates (macaques) onto a common space. We use white matter bundles to anchor the definition of the common space and employ the uniqueness of the areal connection patterns to these bundles to probe areal specialisation. This enables us to quantitatively study divergences and similarities in cortical connectivity over both evolutionary and developmental scales. It further allows us to map brain maturation trajectories, including the effect of premature birth, and to translate cortical atlases between diverse brains.
