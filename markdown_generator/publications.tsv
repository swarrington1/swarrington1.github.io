Tractography dissection variability what happens when 42 groups dissect 14 white matter bundles on the same dataset	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.321083v1	White matter bundle segmentation using diffusion MRI fiber tractography has become the method of choice to identify white matter fiber pathways in vivo in human brains. However, like other analyses of complex data, there is considerable variability in segmentation protocols and techniques. This can result in different reconstructions of the same intended white matter pathways, which directly affects tractography results, quantification, and interpretation. In this study, we aim to evaluate and quantify the variability that arises from different protocols for bundle segmentation. Through an open call to users of fiber tractography, including anatomists, clinicians, and algorithm developers, 42 independent teams were given processed sets of human whole-brain streamlines and asked to segment 14 white matter fascicles on six subjects. In total, we received 57 different bundle segmentation protocols, which enabled detailed volume-based and streamline-based analyses of agreement and disagreement among protocols for each fiber pathway. Results show that even when given the exact same sets of underlying streamlines, the variability in the protocols for bundle segmentation is greater than all other sources of variability in the virtual dissection process, including variability within protocols and variability across subjects. In order to foster the use of tractography bundle dissection in routine clinical settings, and as a fundamental analytical tool, future endeavors must aim to resolve and reduce this heterogeneity. Although external validation is needed to verify the anatomical accuracy of bundle dissections, reducing heterogeneity is a step twowards reproducible research and may be achieved through the use of standard nomenclature and definitions of white matter bundles and well-chosen constraints and decisions in the dissection process.

(2020). "On stability of Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares with application to brain-behavior associations" <i>BioRxiv</i>.	On stability of Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares with application to brain-behavior associations	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.265546v1	Associations between high-dimensional datasets, each comprising many features, can be discovered through multivariate statistical methods, like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) or Partial Least Squares (PLS). CCA and PLS are widely used methods which reveal which features carry the association. Despite the longevity and popularity of CCA/PLS approaches, their application to high-dimensional datasets raises critical questions about the reliability of CCA/PLS solutions. In particular, overfitting can produce solutions that are not stable across datasets, which severely hinders their interpretability and generalizability. To study these issues, we developed a generative model to simulate synthetic datasets with multivariate associations, parameterized by feature dimensionality, data variance structure, and assumed latent association strength. We found that resulting CCA/PLS associations could be highly inaccurate when the number of samples per feature is relatively small. For PLS, the profiles of feature weights exhibit detrimental bias toward leading principal component axes. We confirmed these model trends in state-ofthe-art datasets containing neuroimaging and behavioral measurements in large numbers of subjects, namely the Human Connectome Project (n ≈ 1000) and UK Biobank (n = 20000), where we found that only the latter comprised enough samples to obtain stable estimates. Analysis of the neuroimaging literature using CCA to map brain-behavior relationships revealed that the commonly employed sample sizes yield unstable CCA solutions. Our generative modeling framework provides a calculator of dataset properties required for stable estimates. Collectively, our study characterizes dataset properties needed to limit the potentially detrimental effects of overfitting on stability of CCA/PLS solutions, and provides practical recommendations for future studies.

(2020) “XTRACT - standardised protocols for automated tractography in the human and macaque brain”, <i>NeuroImage</i>, vol. 217.	XTRACT - standardised protocols for automated tractography in the human and macaque brain	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920304092	We present a new software package with a library of standardised tractography protocols devised for the robust automated extraction of white matter tracts both in the human and the macaque brain. Using in vivo data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the UK Biobank and ex vivo data for the macaque brain datasets, we obtain white matter atlases, as well as atlases for tract endpoints on the white-grey matter boundary, for both species. We illustrate that our protocols are robust against data quality, generalisable across two species and reflect the known anatomy. We further demonstrate that they capture inter-subject variability by preserving tract lateralisation in humans and tract similarities stemming from twinship in the HCP cohort. Our results demonstrate that the presented toolbox will be useful for generating imaging-derived features in large cohorts, and in facilitating comparative neuroanatomy studies. The software, tractography protocols, and atlases are publicly released through FSL, allowing users to define their own tractography protocols in a standardised manner, further contributing to open science.

(2019) “A Method of Correcting for the Effect of Temperature on Low-Contrast Penetration Measurement in Urethane Phantoms”, <i>Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology</i>, vol. 45, no. 6.	A Method of Correcting for the Effect of Temperature on Low-Contrast Penetration Measurement in Urethane Phantoms	https://www.umbjournal.org/article/S0301-5629(19)30079-1/abstract	Urethane-based test objects are routinely used for ultrasound quality assurance because of their durability and robustness. The acoustic properties of these phantoms including speed of sound and attenuation, however, have a strong dependence on temperature. Reliable measurement of low-contrast penetration, which is widely used for ultrasound system quality assurance testing, with these phantoms is therefore problematic. To alleviate this, a correction method was proposed using speed of sound estimated by measuring filament target separation. The method was developed using a range of 17 transducer geometry and frequency combinations across 5 ultrasound systems and validated using a further 5 systems. This was found to reduce the uncertainty of low-contrast penetration measurement from an average 17.6 mm to 4.9 mm over the temperature range 8°C to 32°C. This represents a greater than threefold improvement in precision of low-contrast penetration measurement.
