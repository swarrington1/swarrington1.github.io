I am currently a PhD Student at the CoNI Lab, University of Nottingham studying the associations between brain connectivity and behaviour supervised by Stamatios Sotiropoulos. During my PhD I have developed FSL's XTRACT for the robust extraction major white matter fibre bundles in the human and macaque brain. In collaboration with the Murray and Anticevic Labs (Yale University), I have recently focused on exploring the stability of multivariate statistical techniques applied to brain-behaviour associations.

Prior to my PhD, I completed the Scientist Training Programme (STP) at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust leading to state registration as a Clinical Scientist. During my STP, I specialised in Imaging with Non-Ionising Radiation and completed a part-time MSc in Clinical Sciences (Medical Physics) at the University of Newcastle.

In addition to my current role, I am also a tutor on the Scholars Programme with the Brilliant Club.
