I am currently a PhD Student at the [CoNI Lab](https://spmic-uon.github.io/conilab/), University of Nottingham studying the associations between brain connectivity and behaviour supervised by Stamatios Sotiropoulos and funded by the [MRC IMPACT DTP](https://more.bham.ac.uk/mrc-impact/). During my PhD I developed [FSL's XTRACT](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/XTRACT) for the standardised and automated extraction of major white matter fibre bundles in the human and macaque brain.

In collaboration with the [Murray](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/murray/) and [Anticevic](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/anticevic/) Labs (Yale University), I have recently focused on exploring the stability of multivariate statistical techniques applied to brain-behaviour associations using large cohort datsets, including the Human Connectome Project (HCP) UK Biobank.

Prior to my PhD, I completed the [Scientist Training Programme (STP)](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/programmes/stp/) at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust leading to state registration as a Clinical Scientist. During my STP, I specialised in Imaging with Non-Ionising Radiation and completed a part-time MSc in Clinical Sciences (Medical Physics) at the University of Newcastle. In my MSc, my disseration focused on using MRI-derived measures of lesion volume and atrophy to better characterise Multiple Sclerosis. In addition, during the STP, I was involved in a project investigating the use of tissue equivalent test objects (TETOs) in ultrasound imaging quality control and how environmental conditions affect measures of image quality and scanner performance. In the final year of my STP, I completed an elective placement at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, China where I focused on image segmentation of CT lung data, contributing to the development of a semi-automated CT-guided brachytherapy system.

In addition to my current role, I am also a tutor on the [Scholars Programme](https://thebrilliantclub.org/the-scholars-programme/) with the Brilliant Club and a [STEM Ambassador](https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors).
